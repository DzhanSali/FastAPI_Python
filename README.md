# FastAPI_Python
 Project with FastAPI, Python, SQLAlchemy that communicates with a 
 frontend developed with React (developed by my tutors from FMI of Plovdiv University).

My project realises an API for the aforementioned frontend with routing, services for buiseness logic,
and SQLite database. Alembic is used for managing migrations of the DB.
